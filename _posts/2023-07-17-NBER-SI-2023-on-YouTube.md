"Inflation is conflict" (Lorenzoni and Werning, 2023) in the NBER SI 2023 monetary economics conference offers a fresh outlook on the micro mechanism of inflation. The authors begin with a static two-agent barter economy, wherein agents take turns setting their own nominal prices while the other agent responds with a take-it-or-leave-it quantity offer. Despite the absence of fiscal and monetary policies in this model, it exhibits inflationary behavior. By demonstrating this in a simple setting, they subsequently extend their insights to a multisector model with networks, deriving a key condition that leads to inflationâ€”effectively linking inflation to conflict. The implications of their findings encompass various forms of inflation under specific assumptions, offering a novel perspective on how we understand inflation.
